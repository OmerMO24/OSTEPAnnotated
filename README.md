# OSTEPAnnotated
Repository with annotated versions of the OSTEP book required for OSC.
Just to let you know, not all of the annotated content is examinable (presumably, anything mentioned IN the video is examinable).
If you are using the annotated chapters to study, I suggest using the following method:
  1. Read the chapter associated with Stephen's video. (Stephen shows what chapter the video covers at the beginning of every video).
  2. Watch the video and take notes using whatever notetaking/study technique you prefer.

I've found that using the method outlined above results in the best understanding of the content possible.
The videos tend to leave out small tidbits of information that would aid in understanding the content, which is why I read the specified chapter first. 

#Schedule 
I will aim to have the week's chapters fully annotated by Saturday night so that everyone with access to this repository can take Sunday to review the annotated chapter if needed.

#Tips 
1. OSC is not a module that is "memorizable". There is far too much multi-layered complex content. Try your best to understand how something works and what problem it solves.
2. USE THE TAs. I cannot stress this enough, please take advantage of the TAs especially when it comes to the coursework, they will guide you in the right direction.


If anyone needs any help or questions, then just let me know/contact me.
